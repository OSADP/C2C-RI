        <section name="Lifecyle of a Jameleon Tag">
            <p>
                When the function tag is executed, Jameleon looks for all instance variables that have 
                a @jameleon.attribute javadoc tag. It then makes those available to the tag via either the 
                instance variable name, or the <b><i>contextName</i></b>. The <b><i>contextName</i></b> is used to 
                bind the value of a variable read in from an external datasource to the instance variable. This 
                makes working with the context as easy as working with instance variables. If using the context, it 
                is a good idea to only use the contextName in your scripts as this will not confuse others that are 
                using external data to drive your tag.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once all of the instance variables are set via the script, Jameleon searches for variables that aren't
                set, but have a <b><i>default="some value"</i></b> setting in the <b><i>@jameleon.attribute</i></b> tag
                and sets the value of the instance variable to the value in the <b><i>default</i></b> setting. Jameleon
                then validates that all instance variables that have <b><i>required=&quot;true&quot;</i></b> in the 
                <b><i>@jameleon.attribute</i></b> javadoc are set to something other than <b><i>null</i></b> for Objects
                or <b><i>0</i></b> for primitive variables. If an instance variable that is marked with
                <b><i>required=&quot;true&quot;</i></b> is not set, then the execution of the tag completes and a message
                is given stating the variable was not set. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Once all of that is done, the <b><i>testBlock()</i></b> method is called. Every function tag should 
                implement this method if it needs to do some sort of action, validation or navigation.
