        <section name="Introduction">
            <p>
                The <b>Getting Started</b> section is intended for people who desire to learn basic principles that 
                can be applied to the available plug-ins when writing automated tests. The best way to use this section 
                is to download the <a target="_new" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=84246&amp;package_id=157342">jameleon-test-suite-x.x.x.zip</a>
                file, where the X's represent version numbers. This file can be unzipped anywhere and has all plug-ins enabled 
                and installed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The examples in this section will use the JUnit plug-in to explain some of the available features. While the JUnit plug-in
                provides very limited functionality, it can be used to teach many automated testing prinicples and it can also be
                used to accomplish tasks that would otherwise be difficult to automate.

            <p>
                Please read the following before proceeding:
                <ol>
                    <li>The <b><i><a target="_new" href="../overview.html">Overview</a></i></b> section talks about basic principles and jargon
                        that Jameleon uses.</li>
                    <li>The <b><i><a target="_new" href="../xmlBasics.html">XML Basics</a></i></b> section teaches the XML principles required to understand and
                        write Jameleon scripts.</li>
                </ol>

        <section name="Jameleon GUI">
            <p>
                The Jameleon GUI provides the ability to generate custom tags, view the properties of existing and custom tags as well as execute
                and debug test scripts. All of these functions will be covered later in the Getting Started section.
            </p>
            <p>
                To run the GUI, double-click on <b>jameleon.bat</b> in the <b>jameleon-test-suite</b> directory. 
            </p>
        </section>
        <section name="Using the GUI to view available tags and their corresponding attributes">
          <p>
            <img src="../images/getting-started/functionTags.jpg"/>
          </p>
          <p>
            The GUI can be used to view the available tags and their attributes. Let's take a look at all tags offered by the JUnit plug-in.
          </p>
          <p>
             Click the <b>Function Tags</b> tab on the bottom-left side of the window. This will display a folder labeled <i>Functional Points</i>. 
             Double-click on Functional Points followed  by the path illustrated above. In the above image, the ju-assert-equals tag is selected. 
             The right side of the GUI shows all of the attributes that are supported by ju-assert-equals.
          </p>
          <p>
             In the <b><i>Attributes</i></b>section, you will notice several attributes. All attributes from functionId down are common across
             all function tags and plug-ins. And everything above functionId is specific to this tag.
